Built a Virtual File system from scratch un C++ using various data types like a tree, linked list and stack. 

The file system has various functions like 
- showing items in a directory
- changing directories
- creating, deteling and moving files and folders
- printing current directory
- deleting and recovery from recycle bin 
- calculating size of a folder

The VFS is stored to a savefile and lodaded upon next run - preserving structure.
